      "<p>We’ve all heard the saying,“Children don’t come with an instruction manual.” It’s true that parenting is no easy feat, and it was a lot tougher before the days of the internet. However, as the 21st century plows ahead, it’s become increasing clear that children do come with an instruction manual -- and it’s called Google.</p>
      <p>There is an endless stream of parenting blogs offering everything from teething advice to reviews on the latest Disney flick, and it may seem a daunting task to narrow them down into a well curated list of sites to turn to when your child has just refinished your hardwood floors with nail polish. Luckily for you, we did all the hard work already.</p>
      <p>We all know new environments and schedules can throw kids for a loop, so give them plenty of time and info to get ready. Get them excited about your vacation destination through picture books or online videos. If this is their first time on a plane, talk through the process of security lines, boarding, and taking off, so they’ll know what to expect.</p>
      <p>It was a kind of charge, across the level, gravelly parade-ground, and the boys were marching well, but right before them stood a high and frowning stone wall and it was of no use to charge against it. It could neither be broken through nor climbed and this one boy, in the middle of the line, was staring at it as if he hated it, while he marched. His feet kept time with the music and perfect pace with the feet of the other boys, but there was an angry look in his black eyes and a hot flush on his face, as if the wall had spoken to him, saying something to rouse his temper and make him answer back. What he did say, was, in a whisper that the next boy to him heard.</p>
      <p>Very nearly all of them, white or colored, moved as if they liked the idea of being young soldiers, but they had not been recruited like other soldiers. Some of them were there because they had no other home to go to nor any other school to be taught in. Many, however, were there for other reasons. For instance, that tall young fellow in command of the foremost company. The captain, in bright uniform who handled his men so well. He is here for highway robbery and it will be a long time before they let him out, although he is one of the best behaved boys in the House of Refuge. He is not here altogether as a punishment, however, nor are any of his companions, no matter what their fault was. This is not a place of judgment, but of help and hope, and, not long ago, a well-known literary man, after inspecting the whole institution, said to the Superintendent.</p>",

      "<p>Last-minute rushing to catch a train or flight is stressful. Dragging kicking and screaming kids along is soul-crushing. Leave extra time to get to the airport or wake up a few minutes early to enjoy a leisurely breakfast if you have to get on the road by a certain time.</p>
      <p>Today is a good day for love, ladies and gents. Today, Modern Family star Sarah Hyland and Bachelorette alum Wells Adams finally announced their engagement. I mean, they’ve been happily dating and so very clearly head-over-heels for each other for over a year, so it’s not like this is a surprise. But we’re reaching for the tissues anyway.</p>
      <p>Nevertheless, before setting out on that errand, he went down into the garden and took a long look at all the land which had been walled in. It might be as good as ever, for a garden, but it had a queer, shut-up appearance.</p>
      <p>“Where’s Billy?” he inquired, aloud. “Hullo. There he is, out on the avenue. How did the old rascal foot it up that wall?”</p>
      <p>There was Billy, indeed, with his toes on the very edge, and with a wisp of something green sticking out at one side of his mouth.</p>
      <p>“Greens!” exclaimed Rodney. “He can steal from a grocer’s wagon better than any other goat I know of.—We used to have a garden. Tell you what, we can make garden of our lots and all the others, too, if we can only have it ploughed. But how would a horse and plough ever get down here?”</p>
      <p>It was a pretty deep question and he gave it up, for that time. In a minute more he was upstairs and out through the window, on his errand to Pat. So far as he knew, he left the house without a living soul in it, but before he reached the next corner, the door of the little back bedroom, at the head of the stairs, went to with a sharp slam. It must have been a strong draft of air that did it, or else the door shut itself.</p>,"

      <p>Wearing heels puts me in my happy place. Doing my hair makes me feel better. When I wear a dress or favorite pair of jeans, I’m my best self. It feels like like a second skin, not a mask.</p>
      <p>Which in 1988 caused enormous drama about who was invited and who wasn’t invited. This indicates a vicious kind of social standing that must be mediated by a teacher. Now you’re not allowed to invite anyone unless you invite the whole damn class. It’s easier on the teacher and makes sure no one feels left out. Prepare your house for an onslaught of thirty children. No wonder parents shell out for a secondary location.</p>",

      "<p>But alas, that’s not what happened. She told me I’d have to wait until I was 16 to own any of those things. I felt like I was going to burst as I sat in the back of our Caprice Classic. When we got home, I stomped off to my room and spent the rest of the afternoon crying and putting on 25 coats of cherry chapstick on the mirror hoping it would darken my lips.</p>
      <p><Admit it: kids’ birthday parties suck. The battle to keep up with the Addisons, the Madisons, the Jacksons and the Jadens become a nuclear arms race of forced fun. Bounce houses, pony rides, magicians and fun parks are the order of the day. Cakes come from high-end bakeries that specialize in molded shit that matches a theme. All parties have a theme. Harry Potter, Star Wars, Ninjago, Disney Princess, My Little Pony: theme, theme, theme. Everything matches. You, personally, may be expected to match/p>"
